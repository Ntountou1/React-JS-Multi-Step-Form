# React-JS-Multi-Step-Form

In this project, I have implemented a Multi Step User Form that implements the European single procurement document (ESPD). The European single procurement document (ESPD) is a self-declaration form used in public procurement procedures. 

It uses the benefits of React JS, such as state management, reusable components, hooks and functional components. 

You can run the project with the command 'npm start' from the main folder.

It gives two different implementation, create a new ESPD and import an existing ESPD.

In the first functionality, the user has to fill out each field of the form with the correct credentials. After he fills out each step of the form, he can export the file as an XML and save it on his computer so he can use it later when needed.

The second functionality lets the user import his existing ESPD file. It converts the XML file to the correct json and it fills all the fields of the form with the correct values of the imported XML. Next, the user can update any field he wants and then he can export the updated file again.
